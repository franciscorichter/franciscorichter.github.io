 <h1> About </h1>
 <p> 
I am a mathematician, passionate about understanding, using and developing stochastic modeling, data sciences and/or complex systems techniques aiming to improve the quality of life of human and non-human beings.

Currently, I am studying the influence of macro-evolution on biodiversity and the influence of ecology on macro-evolution as a PhD candidate of the University of Groningen.

I am also an Amatsu Tatara medicine student, so also passionate about understanding how the body works.

I am interested on multidisciplinary collaboration.

Currently I have a full-time job which I love, so I do not have much free time, however I am willing to collaborate or give support (as a mathematician) to non-profit organizations which are working to have a better world/society, specially empowering people. In particular, I am happy to help on projects which involves feminist principles and/or respect to nature.

I am also interested on projects where Mathematics could be a helpful and beautiful tool for doing Art.

  I am interested on study complex systems of ecological interactions in relationship with macro-evolutionary processes.
