# Chapter 3: Deep Learning

## 3.1 Introduction
Deep learning has significantly influenced the way we handle **representation learning** in network analysis. Representation is key to any machine learning system. For example, in simpler cases like classifying objects by weight or height, the dataâ€™s representation is evident. However, in real-world applications, finding a good representation is more challenging but crucial for successful machine learning.

One of the hallmarks of deep learning systems is **representation learning**, where the system learns the representation directly from the data. This chapter explores the foundations of deep learning in network analysis.

## 3.2 Neural Networks
### 3.2.1 Perceptron
A **perceptron** is one of the earliest models for binary classifiers. It works by assigning weights to input features and updating these weights based on the classification error. The perceptron is the building block of neural networks.

\[
y = \text{sgn} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + b \right)
\]

Where:
- \( y \) is the predicted class,
- \( w_i \) are the weights for each input feature \( x_i \),
- \( b \) is the bias term.

### 3.2.2 Characteristics of Neural Networks
A neural network consists of multiple layers, including input, hidden, and output layers. Each layer contains nodes or neurons connected by edges that store weights.

### 3.2.3 Multilayer Perceptron Networks
A **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** consists of one or more hidden layers between the input and output layers. MLPs are capable of capturing non-linear relationships in data. Each layer applies an **activation function** to introduce non-linearity.

The activation function used in hidden layers is commonly the **ReLU** function:

\[
f(x) = \max(0, x)
\]

### 3.2.4 Training MLP Networks
Training a neural network involves adjusting the weights using **backpropagation**, which calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight.

\[
w \leftarrow w - \eta \frac{\partial L}{\partial w}
\]

Where:
- \( \eta \) is the learning rate,
- \( L \) is the loss function.

## 3.3 Convolutional Neural Networks
### 3.3.1 Activation Function
In CNNs, each neuron is activated by applying an activation function. The commonly used function is **sigmoid** or **tanh**, but **ReLU** is widely favored for its simplicity and computational efficiency.

### 3.3.2 Initialization of Weights
Weight initialization is important for ensuring efficient training. One commonly used method is **Xavier initialization**, which sets the weights such that the variance of the inputs and outputs remains constant throughout the layers.

\[
W \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \frac{2}{n_{\text{in}} + n_{\text{out}}})
\]

### 3.3.3 Deep Feedforward Neural Network
A **Deep Feedforward Neural Network (DFNN)** involves multiple layers with directed connections, where the output of one layer is passed to the next without forming cycles. 

## 3.4 Recurrent Networks
### 3.4.1 Recurrent Neural Networks
**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** are specialized for sequence data by introducing connections between layers to maintain memory over time. Each output is a function of both the input and the previous state.

The update equation for RNNs can be written as:

\[
h_t = \sigma(W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t + b)
\]

Where:
- \( h_t \) is the hidden state at time step \( t \),
- \( W_h \) and \( W_x \) are the weight matrices,
- \( \sigma \) is an activation function.

### 3.4.2 Long Short Term Memory
**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks improve upon RNNs by allowing longer memory retention. The key innovation is the **cell state**, which can maintain its state over time with minimal updates, controlled by gates:

- **Forget gate**: Decides what to forget from the cell state.
- **Input gate**: Determines what information to store.
- **Output gate**: Decides the next hidden state based on the cell state.

The forget gate is defined as:

\[
f_t = \sigma(W_f [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)
\]

## 3.5 Learning Representations Using Autoencoders
### 3.5.1 Types of Autoencoders
**Autoencoders** are neural networks used for unsupervised learning to compress input data and then reconstruct it. They consist of two parts:
- **Encoder**: Compresses the input.
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs the input from the compressed version.

## 3.6 Summary
In this chapter, we explored the fundamental architectures used in deep learning, including perceptrons, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and autoencoders. These models are essential for network data analysis and representation learning.
