**DeepCausal** is a framework that applies deep learning techniques to uncover causal relationships in large, complex datasets. It combines the rigor of causal inference with the flexibility of neural networks, aiming for more accurate and interpretable results in causal discovery.

Key Features:
- Causal inference for high-dimensional data
- Deep learning integration for enhanced performance
- Flexible, scalable design
