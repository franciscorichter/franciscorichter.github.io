Welcome to my personal website. I am Francisco Richter, a postdoctoral researcher at the [Statistical Computing Laboratory](https://www.ci.inf.usi.ch/research/statslab/people/) at the Università della Svizzera italiana specializing in statistical network sciences, species diversification, phylogenetic inference, and data sciences. I hold a PhD from the University of Groningen in Statistical Network Sciences and Evolutionary Biology, and a degree in Mathematical Engineering from Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María.

My research interests lie at the intersection of complex systems, biostatistics, and computational biology, with a particular focus on understanding how systems evolve and diversify over time.

On this site, you will find more information about my publications, talks, teaching, and a dynamically generated CV.
