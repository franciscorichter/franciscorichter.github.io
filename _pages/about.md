I’m Francisco Richter-Mendoza, a postdoctoral researcher and mathematical engineer at the [Statistical Computing Laboratory](https://www.ci.inf.usi.ch/research/statslab/people/) at Università della Svizzera italiana. My work centers on data science, predictive modeling, and statistical network sciences, applied to areas such as species diversification, phylogenetics, and environmental data.

My approach combines three main pillars:

- **Teaching**: I teach courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels in data science, network analysis, and statistical methods, and I supervise master’s theses in the Master in Computational Science and the Master in Artificial Intelligence programs. My goal is to bridge theory and practice, preparing students to tackle real-world challenges in academia and industry.

- **Research**: My research focuses on developing statistical methodologies for complex systems, with recent work on diversification dynamics and environmental data imputation. I am committed to interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly between Chile and Switzerland, to advance knowledge across diverse fields.

- **Applied Mathematics**: I apply statistical techniques to solve practical problems, transforming mathematical concepts into impactful tools for technology transfer and real-world applications.

This website provides an overview of my academic journey, organized into the following sections:

- **Teaching**: Courses and resources for students, as well as information on master’s thesis supervision for the Master in Computational Science and Master in Artificial Intelligence programs.
- **Publications**: Research contributions across various fields.
- **Portfolio**: Applied projects that highlight practical problem-solving.
- **Blog Posts**: Insights, tutorials, and updates on research and teaching.
