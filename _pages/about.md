I’m Francisco Richter-Mendoza, a postdoctoral researcher at the [Statistical Computing Laboratory](https://www.ci.inf.usi.ch/research/statslab/people/) at Università della Svizzera italiana. This platform showcases my work and insights in data science, predictive modeling, and statistical network sciences. My research explores how these methodologies can be applied to understand complex systems, such as species diversification, phylogenetic inference, and microbiome-environment interactions.

On this site, you'll find not only information about my background and expertise but also resources focused on data-driven research and predictive modeling tools. These tools are essential for making sense of the vast amount of data available today and for generating meaningful predictions about how biological and computational systems evolve over time.
