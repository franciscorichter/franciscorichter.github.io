<div class="introduction">
  <p>
    I’m <strong>Francisco Richter-Mendoza</strong>, a 
    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/franciscorichter/franciscorichter.github.io/master/files/CV.pdf" target="_blank">
      postdoctoral researcher and mathematical engineer
    </a> 
    at the 
    <a href="https://www.ci.inf.usi.ch/research/statslab/people/" target="_blank">
      Statistical Computing Laboratory
    </a> 
    at Università della Svizzera italiana. My work centers on developing innovative methods in data science, predictive stochastic modeling, and statistical network sciences to address complex real-world problems.

  <h2>My Approach</h2>
  <p>My work is built upon three core pillars:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Teaching</strong>: Engaging undergraduate and graduate students with courses in data science, network analysis, and statistical methods. I also supervise master’s theses for the Master in Computational Science and the Master in Artificial Intelligence programs—blending pedagogy with cutting-edge research.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Research</strong>: Developing advanced statistical methodologies to tackle complex systems, with a focus on diversification dynamics and environmental data imputation. I actively foster interdisciplinary collaborations, particularly between Chile and Switzerland.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Applied Mathematics</strong>: Applying robust statistical techniques to solve practical challenges, effectively transforming theoretical mathematical concepts into innovative, real-world solutions.
    </li>
  </ul>
