I’m Francisco Richter-Mendoza, a postdoctoral researcher at the [Statistical Computing Laboratory](https://www.ci.inf.usi.ch/research/statslab/people/) at Università della Svizzera italiana, with a rich background in both academic research and applied projects. As a mathematical engineer, my journey spans diverse fields, from environmental data modeling to operational risk analysis.

My current research focuses on developing statistical methods for diversification dynamics across species, as well as building predictive models and imputation techniques for environmental data. These projects explore how patterns of diversity emerge in nature and how advanced data methods can help solve real-world problems.

I’m also actively involved in shaping the educational landscape, having contributed to the creation of the Data Science program at Università della Svizzera italiana (USI), where I engage students in real-world projects to bridge the gap between theory and application. I'm passionate about fostering international collaboration between Chile and Switzerland, helping students and researchers engage in cutting-edge projects that span continents.

Beyond academia, my applied work extends into technology transfer, collaborating with organizations such as OASI on environmental data projects and developing AI tools with Laboratorio Textil in Chile, bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical solutions.

As I continue expanding my research, I am also seeking to secure funding through Ambizione and Bridge grants, with plans to advance my work in causal inference, meta-learning, and interdisciplinary applications across biology and environmental sciences.

I'm also writing a book on probability and statistics, which is set to be published soon, aiming to make complex concepts accessible through a blend of theory, examples, and practical applications.

### Let's Collaborate
I am always open to new collaborations, whether it's research projects, academic discussions, or practical applications of predictive modeling. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:richtf@usi.ch) if you're interested in working together or have any questions.
