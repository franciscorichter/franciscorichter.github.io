I’m Francisco Richter-Mendoza, a postdoctoral researcher and mathematical engineer at the [Statistical Computing Laboratory](https://www.ci.inf.usi.ch/research/statslab/people/) at Università della Svizzera italiana. My work focuses on solving complex problems using data science, predictive modeling, and statistical network sciences, applied to fields like species diversification, phylogenetics, and environmental data.

I have contributed to the development of the Data Science program at USI, and I engage students in real-world projects that connect theory to practice. I also foster international collaborations, particularly between Chile and Switzerland, to promote interdisciplinary research.

Currently, I’m working on statistical methods for diversification dynamics and environmental data imputation, while exploring technology transfer opportunities through collaborations with OASI and Laboratorio Textil. 

Feel free to explore my work, and if you’re interested in collaborating or learning more, [get in touch](mailto:richtf@usi.ch).
