I’m Francisco Richter-Mendoza, a [postdoctoral researcher and mathematical engineer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/franciscorichter/franciscorichter.github.io/master/files/CV.pdf) at the [Statistical Computing Laboratory](https://www.ci.inf.usi.ch/research/statslab/people/) at Università della Svizzera italiana. My work centers on data science, predictive stochastic modeling, and statistical network sciences, applied to diverse areas.

My approach integrates three main pillars:

- **Teaching**: Engaging students at undergraduate and graduate levels through courses in data science, network analysis, and statistical methods. I also supervise master’s theses for the Master in Computational Science and the Master in Artificial Intelligence programs, which I consider in the intersection of teaching and research. 

- **Research**: Developing statistical methodologies for complex systems, with a focus on diversification dynamics and environmental data imputation. I pursue interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly between Chile and Switzerland, to advance knowledge across diverse fields.

- **Applied Mathematics**: Applying statistical techniques to solve practical problems, turning mathematical concepts into impactful tools for technology transfer and real-world solutions.

I’m fortunate to have worked with inspiring mentors from diverse fields, whose guidance continues to shape my work. I also engage with students and colleagues from various experience levels, valuing the blend of perspectives that enriches our multidisciplinary, international, and collaborative projects.
