I’m Francisco Richter-Mendoza, a postdoctoral researcher and mathematical engineer at the [Statistical Computing Laboratory](https://www.ci.inf.usi.ch/research/statslab/people/) at Università della Svizzera italiana. My work focuses on solving complex problems using data science, predictive modeling, and statistical network sciences, applied to fields like species diversification, phylogenetics, and environmental data.

I have contributed to the development of the Data Science program at USI, and I engage students in real-world projects that connect theory to practice. I also foster international collaborations, particularly between Chile and Switzerland, to promote interdisciplinary research.

Currently, I’m working on statistical methods for diversification dynamics and environmental data imputation, while exploring technology transfer opportunities through collaborations.

This website provides an overview of my academic work and interests, organized into the following sections:

- **Teaching**: A collection of the courses I teach, focusing on data science, network analysis, and statistical methods. Each course page provides an outline of topics covered, learning objectives, and resources for students.
  
- **Publications**: A list of my research publications, showcasing my contributions to fields like network science, predictive modeling, and statistical applications in biology and environmental science.

- **Portfolio**: Selected projects that highlight my expertise in applying statistical methods to complex datasets, with real-world applications in science and engineering.

- **Blog Posts**: Articles where I share insights, tutorials, and updates on my ongoing research and teaching projects.
