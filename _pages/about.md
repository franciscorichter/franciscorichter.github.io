I’m Francisco Richter-Mendoza, a postdoctoral researcher and mathematical engineer at the [Statistical Computing Laboratory](https://www.ci.inf.usi.ch/research/statslab/people/) at Università della Svizzera italiana. My work centers on data science, predictive modeling, and statistical network sciences, applied to areas such as species diversification, phylogenetics, and environmental data.

My approach combines three main pillars:

- **Teaching**: I am dedicated to empowering students with practical skills in data science, network analysis, and statistical methods. My courses integrate theory with real-world applications, preparing students for challenges in academia and industry.

- **Research**: I focus on developing statistical methodologies for complex systems, with recent work on diversification dynamics and environmental data imputation. My research aims to uncover patterns and insights across diverse fields through interdisciplinary collaboration, especially between Chile and Switzerland.

- **Applied Mathematics**: I apply statistical techniques to solve practical problems, translating mathematical concepts into tools for technology transfer and real-world impact.

This website provides an overview of my academic journey, organized into the following sections:

- **Teaching**: Courses and resources for students.
- **Publications**: Research contributions across various fields.
- **Portfolio**: Applied projects demonstrating practical problem-solving.
- **Blog Posts**: Insights, tutorials, and updates on research and teaching.
