I’m Francisco Richter-Mendoza, a postdoctoral researcher with a passion for unraveling complex systems using data science and predictive modeling. Currently, I work at the [Statistical Computing Laboratory](https://www.ci.inf.usi.ch/research/statslab/people/) at Università della Svizzera italiana, where my research focuses on using statistical network sciences to tackle challenges in areas such as species diversification, phylogenetic inference, and microbiome-environment interactions.

This site provides insights into my research, along with tools and resources for data-driven analysis and predictive modeling. These methodologies are crucial for interpreting the vast amounts of data we face today and for generating meaningful predictions in fields like biology, computation, and beyond.

### What I Do
- **Data Science:** Developing cutting-edge models for data analysis and prediction.
- **Statistical Network Sciences:** Understanding the structure and behavior of complex systems.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Applying advanced methods to forecast system behavior across various domains.

### Let's Collaborate
I am always open to new collaborations, whether it's research projects, academic discussions, or practical applications of predictive modeling. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:your.email@example.com) if you're interested in working together or have any questions.
