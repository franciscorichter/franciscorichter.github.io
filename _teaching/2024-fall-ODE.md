This course provides a comprehensive foundation in **ordinary differential equations (ODEs)**, emphasizing their importance in modeling real-world systems. 

### **Course Content**

1. **Introduction to Differential Equations**  
   - Basic definitions, classifications, and examples.  
   - Role of ODEs in modeling physical, biological, and engineering systems.

2. **First-Order Differential Equations**  
   - Analytical solutions using separation of variables and integrating factors.  
   - Practical examples from biology and mechanics.

3. **Second-Order Differential Equations**  
   - Methods for solving second-order ODEs.  
   - Applications to mechanical vibrations, electrical circuits, and population dynamics.

4. **Numerical Methods for Differential Equations**  
   - Introduction to numerical approximation techniques:  
     - Euler’s Method.  
     - Improved Euler’s and Modified Euler’s Methods.  
     - Runge-Kutta Methods (up to fourth order).  
   - Practical exercises implementing these techniques for real-world problems.

5. **Applications of Differential Equations**  
   - Case studies in engineering, physics, and ecology.  
   - Connecting ODE solutions to practical systems and data.

6. **Advanced Topics**  
   - Stability analysis and Lyapunov’s methods.  
   - Introduction to bifurcation theory and its implications in dynamic systems.  
   - Exploring phase planes and qualitative behavior of solutions.
