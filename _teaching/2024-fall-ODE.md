Description

The course on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) covers a comprehensive range of topics essential for understanding and solving differential equations. It begins with an introduction to the basic definitions and importance of differential equations in modeling real-world systems. The course then delves into various methods for solving first-order and second-order differential equations, including separation of variables, integrating factors, and numerical methods such as Euler's method and Runge-Kutta methods. Additionally, the course explores applications of ODEs in mechanical vibrations, electrical circuits, and other systems. Advanced topics such as stability theory, Lyapunovâ€™s direct method, and bifurcation theory are also discussed to provide students with a thorough understanding of the subject .
