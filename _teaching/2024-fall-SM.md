This course covers foundational and advanced topics in stochastic processes, with a focus on both theory and practical applications. Students learn to model randomness in systems and analyze probabilistic phenomena through various methods. 

## Course Overview

The course explores a wide array of stochastic models and techniques, including:

- **Random Variables and Distributions**: Understanding basic probability concepts like random variables, expectation, variance, and moments, along with specific distributions such as binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions.
  
- **Markov Chains**: Studying stochastic processes where the future state depends only on the current state. Topics include transition matrices, Chapman-Kolmogorov equations, and limit distributions.

- **Poisson Processes**: Delving into counting processes, particularly the Poisson process and its variants such as homogeneous and non-homogeneous Poisson processes.

- **Random Networks**: Introducing random graphs, branching processes, and Markov Decision Processes (MDP), including real-world applications in network analysis and decision-making.

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Learning about Monte Carlo methods, random number generators, and simulations of both discrete and continuous random variables.

- **Stochastic Optimization**: Covering topics such as evolutionary algorithms, stochastic gradient descent, and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.

## Key Learning Objectives

1. **Master Stochastic Concepts**: Grasp core principles of stochastic methods, including understanding and applying random variables, distributions, and stochastic processes.
   
2. **Analyze Markov Chains**: Develop the ability to model and analyze Markov Chains, exploring their long-term behavior through limit theorems and transition matrices.

3. **Apply Stochastic Simulation**: Use Monte Carlo methods and stochastic optimization to solve real-world problems, focusing on both discrete and continuous scenarios.

4. **Explore Network Models**: Understand how random networks function, with a focus on network structures and stochastic models such as branching processes.

5. **Optimize Through Stochastic Algorithms**: Learn to apply algorithms like stochastic gradient descent and MCMC methods in optimization problems.

## Example Topics Covered:

- Expectation and Variance of Random Variables
- Continuous-Time Markov Chains and Birth-Death Processes
- Renewal and Queuing Theories
- Poisson Process Applications in Time and Space
- Simulation Techniques: Monte Carlo Methods and Random Number Generation
- Optimization Techniques: Stochastic Gradient Descent and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
