# Master Thesis Supervision

I am dedicated to mentoring graduate students in advanced research areas, focusing on topics that integrate statistical methods, machine learning, and environmental data science. Below is a list of ongoing and completed theses that I have supervised, highlighting innovative research in species diversification, environmental data imputation, and more.

## Ongoing Theses

### Imputation and Prediction of OASI Environmental Data
**Student**: Federica Marini  
**Year**: 2024  
**Focus**: This ongoing research aims to improve the accuracy and completeness of OASI’s environmental data through advanced imputation techniques and predictive modeling. The project has direct implications for environmental data reliability and supports OASI's efforts in environmental monitoring.

## Completed Theses

### Stochastic Learning for Species Diversification Dynamics
**Student**: Lodovico Mazzei  
**Year**: 2023  
**Description**: This thesis developed an inference framework for species diversification models, employing stochastic gradient descent and the generalized method of moments for parameter inference. It includes simulation studies on diversity-dependent and temperature-dependent models.
