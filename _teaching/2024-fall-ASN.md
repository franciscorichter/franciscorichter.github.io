Social network analysis reveals how connections between individuals and groups influence their actions. This course covers fundamental principles, statistical methodologies, and practical applications in the field. 

## Course Content

- **Introduction to Networks and Graphs**  
  - Foundational concepts in network structures and graph theory, including basic representations and data structures.

- **Describing Network Structure**  
  - Methods for summarizing network characteristics such as centrality measures, degree distribution, and network density.

- **Network Modeling**  
  - Statistical models for network structure, focusing on capturing relationships and dependencies.

- **Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs)**  
  - Application of ERGMs to identify network patterns and relational dependencies.

- **Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOMs)**  
  - Modeling network evolution over time, with a focus on actors' behaviors and changes in network structure.

- **Relational Event Models (REMs)**  
  - Dynamic network analysis for understanding sequences of events and interactions between network actors.

- **Machine Learning for Network Analysis**  
  - Application of machine learning techniques in network data analysis, focusing on predictive modeling and pattern discovery.

- **Deep Learning for Networks**  
  - Exploration of deep learning methods to uncover complex structures in large-scale networks, with applications in social and biological data.

This course combines theoretical concepts with practical applications, equipping students with essential tools for analyzing real-world network data across various domains.
