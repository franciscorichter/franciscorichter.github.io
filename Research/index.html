  I am currently developing my PhD project at the <a href="http://www.math.rug.nl" rel="self" targe="_blank"> Johann Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science </a> and the <a href="http://www.rug.nl/research/gelifes/gelifes" rel="self" targe="_blank"> Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences </a> under the supervision of <a href=" 
http://www.rug.nl/staff/r.s.etienne/research" rel="self" target="_blank"> Rampal Etienne </a> and <a href=" http://www.rug.nl/staff/e.c.wit/ " rel="self" target="_blank"> Erns Wit </a>
 </p>
 <p> 
  I am interested on study complex systems of ecological interactions in relationship with macro-evolutionary processes.
 </p>


  In particular I am focused on studying the following questions


<ul><p>
    <li>How diversity influences diversification</li>
    <li>At what extent we can infer evolutionary processes with the available information we get from nature?, how fast is that information growing?</li>
    <li>How are asambles of species configured</li></p>
</ul>

An informal colection of experiments and results can be found <a href="https://github.com/franciscorichter/dmea/wiki" rel="self" target="_blank">here</a>.
