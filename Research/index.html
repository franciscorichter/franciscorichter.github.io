 <p> 
  I am interested in study complex systems of ecological interactions in relationship with macro-evolutionary processes.
 </p>
  In particular I am focused on studying the following questions
<ul><p>
    <li>How diversity influences diversification</li>
    <li>At what extent we can infer evolutionary processes with the available information we get from nature?, how fast is that information growing?</li>
    <li>How are asambles of species configured</li></p>
</ul>

An informal colection of experiments and results can be found <a href="https://github.com/franciscorichter/dmea/wiki" rel="self" target="_blank">here</a>.
